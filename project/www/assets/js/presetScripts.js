A spot shines on him.\n\nBONO\nWell hello there! Welcome to Synctory; a platform for building multi-linear narratives for theatre, films and video games. Don't worry if this looks a little daunting at first. For now, all you have to do is scroll!\n\nThe light cuts out. Prop men start changing the scene around him.\n\nBONO\nThis column here is a location. I'm in an auditorium! This script has three locations, indicated by the three columns. Let's move to the next one.\n\nBONO walks offstage.","active":true},{"key":32,"location":5,"steps":[0],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":36,"location":6,"steps":[0],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":1,"location":"0","steps":[1],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":33,"location":5,"steps":[1],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO finds his way past the actors and crew.\n\nBONO\nNow I'm backstage. Notice how I've changed columns.\n\nA man dressed as Churchill waddles by.\n\nBONO\nThis white box is called a Unit. It's like the atom of your script. Every time someone enters or leaves a location, you need to make a new unit! You'll see why later.\n\nBONO opens the fire escape door.","active":true},{"key":37,"location":6,"steps":[1],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":34,"location":0,"steps":[17],"entities":["CHICKENS"],"text":"A flurry of CHICKENS enter the auditorium, causing havoc and mayhem.","active":true},{"key":35,"location":5,"steps":[17],"entities":[],"text":"New Unit","active":false},{"key":38,"location":6,"steps":[17],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO walks into the sunlight\n\nBONO\nSo the columns are locations, but what about the rows? Well they're called 'steps'. Each step has a label way over on the left there. See this one? It's my favourite!\n\nSomeone shuts the fire escape door behind him.\n\nBONO\nSo this row is a step, and everything on this row is happening at the same time. Have a look and see what's happening back in the auditorium. Go on, I'll wait.\n\nBONO taps his foot impatiently while you have a look at the first column.\n\nBONO\nSee! Of course I have no idea what's going on, because I'm outside right now. I wonder if I can get back in...","active":true},{"key":39,"location":0,"steps":[18],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":40,"location":5,"steps":[18],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO dives through a window into the backstage area.\n\nBONO\n(wiping glass shards off his jacket) Phew. So let's have a quick review. Columns are locations, rows are steps (time), and box right here is a unit. That's the basics. In the next step we'll get more advanced.","active":true},{"key":41,"location":6,"steps":[18],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":42,"location":0,"steps":[19],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":43,"location":5,"steps":[19],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO\nSo a major pain when writing multi-threaded narratives is keeping track of where everyone is, so that one character is never in two places at once. Look at the unit to the right of this one. There's a man called Bonot over there!\n\nLet's out a small laugh.\n\nBONO\nWhat a ridiculous name. Tell you what. Why don't you change it to my name. Go on.\n\nBONO waits while you change Bonot's name to BONO.\n\nBONO\nDid you see? We went all inverse! That means there's a conflict, and you have a character in more than one place in this step. Quick, change it back.\n\nBONO waits while you give Bonot his name back.\n\nBONO\nIt's not just characters either. Anything in caps will be treated as an 'entity'. 'Entities' are unique objects in your script. In the other unit, an apple is declared as an entity. Try typing apple here.\n\nType 'apple' in caps:\n\nBONO\nNice! Now delete it so everything looks nice again. This is giving me a migraine. Next step we'll learn about unit controls.

You can turn these into units by clicking on them. Give it a go.\n\nClick on the empty units on either side.\n\nBONO\nNow you can fill them with your beautiful words. But sometimes, we need to destroy, right? To remove a unit, click the black circle in the top right. Try deleting the two units you just made.\n\nClick the black circles in the top right corners of the units.\n\nBONO\nBe careful! You'll lose all those wonderful words when you do this.","active":true},{"key":47,"location":6,"steps":[20],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":49,"location":5,"steps":[21],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO\nNext up are the grow (+) and shrink (-) buttons at the bottom.

This is useful for when lots of things (entrances and exits) are happening in one location while not much is happening in another. Try it yourself! Click the unit to the top left of this one to activate it, then press (+) to make it grow.\n\nTry to recreate the unit on the left in the next column.\n\nBONO\nGood job! You can now shrink it  too (-). If you can't shrink the unit any more, but need to slot in another entrance or exit, you can insert a step by splitting () the unit instead.

For instance, if we were going to make a play, we'd want the actors to each have a script describing where they will be at any time. However, the director(s) will need scripts that are locked to a location, so that they can stage the entrances and exits.\n\nBONO walks back, taking centre stage.","active":true},{"key":56,"location":6,"steps":[23],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":57,"location":0,"steps":[24],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"Spot light turns back on.\n\nBONO\n(gags) What is that smell? Anyway, let's get this printed. When we compile a script, we have to choose a focus. You can focus on a location or an entity (character). Of course, you will focus on me, because I have shades.\n\nBONO tips his glass frame towards a chicken manure adorned auditorium.\n\nBONO\nIn the top left of the screen are two buttons. 'My Scripts' is where you can open and create new scripts, you've been there before. 'Print Script' is what we want. After clicking it, select 'By Entity', after which you'll see a list of all the entities in the script. Click me! Click me!\n\nClick on 'Print Scripts -> By Entity -> Bono'.\n\nBONO\nBeautiful! The syntax is almost identical to a screenplay, except we have [square brackets] to act as time landmarks. This is why you need to name your steps! To rename one, just click on it. If you've timed it all out you could but a timestamp, or maybe a sound, or even your own handle.\n\nClick on the step to the left and name it.\n\nBONO\nNice naming. You can rename locations and even the title in the same way.\n\nUnveiling a teleportation device, BONO disappears in a puff of exuberance.","active":true},{"key":58,"location":5,"steps":[24],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":59,"location":6,"steps":[24],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":60,"location":0,"steps":[25],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":61,"location":5,"steps":[25],"entities":[],"text":"","active":false},{"key":62,"location":6,"steps":[25],"entities":["BONO"],"text":"BONO materialises back outside.\n\nBONO\nWell that's it for this tutorial.
